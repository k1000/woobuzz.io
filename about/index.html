    <h1>About Wobuzz Radio</h1>

    <p>Wobuzz Radio is a slow, non‑commercial radio station dedicated to deep listening and long‑form music discovery. Instead of chasing algorithms and mainstream trends, Wobuzz focuses on alternative, non‑mainstream sounds that reward your attention and invite you to stay with the music for a while.</p>

    <h2>Why Wobuzz Exists</h2>
    <p>Wobuzz was born from nostalgia for classic radio—a time when competent presenters introduced and educated listeners about genres, bands, and artists. Those presenters didn't just play tracks; they told stories, shared context, and guided you through musical landscapes with expertise and passion.</p>

    <p>Most music platforms today optimize for endless scrolling and short‑term engagement, feeding you what's popular rather than what's interesting. Wobuzz exists as an antidote: a calm corner of the internet where real music connoisseurs can reconnect with the joy of intentional listening—no ads, no algorithms, no commercial pressure.</p>

    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Radio shows built around themes, stories, and sonic explorations rather than charts or playlists.</li>
      <li>Extended mixes designed for work, reading, creative sessions, or simply watching the day move by.</li>
      <li>Alternative and non‑mainstream music from across genres and eras—sounds you won't find on commercial radio.</li>
      <li>An evolving roster of AI-powered presenters with distinct personalities, voices, and musical expertise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>Every show is researched and curated with care, searching for the best balance of entertainment, education, and discovery. We don't just compile playlists—we craft journeys through sound, considering how each track flows into the next, how moods shift and evolve, and how context enriches the listening experience.</p>

    <p>Each show begins with a theme, not a formula. We assemble sequences that feel coherent, surprising, and emotionally resonant—drawing from deep catalogues, forgotten records, and underground scenes. The goal is not to be everything for everyone, but to be a trusted companion for listeners who care about how music flows over time and value sonic adventurousness over mainstream familiarity.</p>

    <h2>For Listeners Who Care</h2>
    <p>Wobuzz is for music connoisseurs who want more than background noise. It's for people who appreciate the craft of sequencing, the discovery of obscure gems, and the space to let unfamiliar sounds reveal themselves. Open a stream, slow down, and let us guide you through musical territories worth exploring.</p>

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    <p>Wobuzz will continue to grow through new shows, diverse musical explorations, and occasional special editions—while staying small, independent, non‑commercial, and ad‑free. If this resonates, tune in, share a show with a fellow connoisseur, or reach out if you'd like to suggest a theme or direction.</p>
